  The chances of opening the safe are slim. You know it from the beginning, and you've tried your luck. 
  You did everything right. 
  Now, however there is little that can be done. 
  <br><br>
  As Alex on this journey, please share with us how you're feeling right now. 
  <br>Please take a moment to reflect on your emotional experience, 
  distinguish and select the one that can best describe your emotion now:

<form method="POST">
  {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
  <tr>
    <td> {% for subfield in form.emo_choice %}
      <label class="spaced-label">{{ subfield }} <strong>{{ subfield.label }}</strong></label>
      {% endfor %}</td>
</tr>

<p class="t_title">
  Please explain your emotions. For example: 
  <br>Why do you feel such emotions, which part of the game makes you feel that way? 
  And why does this emotion outweigh the other two for you?
    <br>
